Ethical Hacking and Cybersecurity is something that has always made me curious. Like instead of just thinking how tto build applications, I'll be wondering how they can break and how to prevent that. I have tried doing a few youtube courses, and it was actually interesting. So, I'm pretty sure that ive come to the right place beacuse being part of WhiteHats would help me learn these concepts practically, interact with like-minded people, and build a strong foundation in cybersecurity and ethical hacking. 

I recently came across an article which discussed the possibility that ISRO's Chandrayan Vikram rover crashed on moon was due to a possible malware threat from a North Korea linked hacker group. However ISRO claims that their system was well protected and the crash was purely due to some software glitches and excessive engine thrust. Whether the cyberattack claim was a rumor or not is a different discussion, but this incident made me realize how important cybersecurity is even for space missions, especially since I had never really thought about the need for secure communication and system protection in space programs before.
